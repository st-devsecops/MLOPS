What is MLOPS. Why everyone needs it.

It is a set of practices that combines Machine Learning (ML), DevOps (software development and IT operations), and Data Engineering to manage the entire Machine Learning lifecycle—from initial experimentation to deployment and continuous monitoring in production.
Think of it this way:
•	A Data Scientist builds a great ML model (the "ML" part).
•	MLOps builds the automated pipeline to take that model, test it thoroughly, deploy it reliably to users, and monitor its performance 24/7 (the "Ops" part).
In essence, MLOps takes the principles of DevOps (like continuous integration, continuous delivery, and automation) and applies them specifically to the unique challenges of machine learning.

here are the key reasons why ML Ops is now considered essential.
o	Data Dependency: It implements continuous monitoring to automatically detect when a model's performance drops or the input data shifts, triggering an alert or even an automated retraining process.
o	Scale and speed: It introduces automation for the entire ML pipeline (data gathering, training, testing, and deployment). This allows companies to deploy new or updated models in minutes instead of weeks
o	Reliability and Consistency: It enforces versioning for the code, the data, and the final model itself. This ensures that you can reliably reproduce an exact result from the past—crucial for debugging, auditing, and regulatory compliance.
o	Better Collaboration: It provides a standardized, shared framework and toolset that bridges these teams, ensuring a smooth handoff from model development to production maintenance.
Who is MLops engineer and what is roles and responsibilities
An MLOps Engineer is a specialized role that sits at the intersection of Machine Learning (ML), DevOps, and Software/Data Engineering. Their primary job is to design, build, and maintain the automated systems (pipelines) that take a model created by a Data Scientist and reliably deploy, manage, and monitor it in a production environment at scale.

Roles:
	Automation & Pipeline Development (CI/CD/CT)
	Infrastructure Management & Deployment
	Model & Data Monitoring
	Versioning, Reproducibility, & Governance
